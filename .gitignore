# Virtual environment
# Poetry typically puts the venv in a .venv/ directory inside the project root,
# but it can also be named 'venv/' or located elsewhere.
# If you've configured Poetry to put virtualenvs outside the project, you don't need this.

# Poetry specific (less common, but good to know)
# Poetry itself generates a poetry.lock file and pyproject.toml.
# These should ALMOST ALWAYS be committed to ensure reproducible builds.

# pyproject.toml
# poetry.lock

/docs/_build/
/site/ # For MkDocs or similar static site generators
